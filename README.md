This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course from Coursera.

To use the run_analysis.R code, please download the data files from this link:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
and set the work directory to wherever you extract the files. 

The program will run and combine the training and testing files into one large dataset. The data is then cleaned by adding new header names. 

The mean and standard deviation values are then calculated and added to the dataset.

The file is writen out into tidydata.txt, and is also uploaded in this repository.
